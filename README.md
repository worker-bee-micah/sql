# sql


Coding examples for the SQL programming language.

General concepts for building tables, select statements, joins and inserts are covered in files that begin with two zeros.

Data sets are chosen for their cross platform compatibility, you should be able to load them into PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQLite3.

I have some SQLite3 examples in this [notebook]{https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/worker-bee-micah/sql/blob/master/00_mt_SQLite_builds.ipynb}, This assumes that you have installed the default configuration of Anaconda.


Some basic Oracle based code examples are included here, you should be able to paste these code blocks into SQL*Develper.
